Eradiate is a next-generation radiative transfer simulation software package for Earth observation applications. It uses advanced Monte Carlo ray tracing techniques and offers a flexible Python interface to simulate radiative transfer on a broad variety of scenes with high accuracy.

**Eradiate is currently in beta stage and is missing many features.**

## Building and using Eradiate

For build and usage instructions, refer to the [documentation](https://eradiate.readthedocs.org).

## About

Eradiate's development is funded by a European Space Agency project supported by the European Commission's Copernicus programme. The design phase was funded by the MetEOC-3 project.

Eradiate's core development team consists of Yves Govaerts, Vincent Leroy, Yvan Nollet, Sebastian Schunke and Nicolas Misk.

Eradiate uses the [Mitsuba 2](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2) renderer as its computational kernel. The Eradiate team acknowledges Mitsuba 2 creators and contributors for their exceptional work.
