## About

Eradiate's development is funded by a European Space Agency project funded by the European Commission's Copernicus programme. The design phase was funded by the MetEOC-3 project.

Eradiate's core development team consists of Yves Govaerts, Vincent Leroy, Yvan Nollet and Sebastian Schunke.

Eradiate uses the [Mitsuba 2](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2) renderer as its computational kernel. The Eradiate team acknowledges Mitsuba 2 creators and contributors for their exceptional work.
