Tutorials
=========

*Due to how our documentation is currently deployed online, we can
only render the output of these examples offline. Consequently, we strongly
advise users to run our examples themselves, either by copying code blocks
found in the tutorials, or by downloading them as Jupyter notebooks.*

The examples presented hereafter are located (alongside their supplementary
files) in the ``$ERADIATE_SOURCE_DIR/docs/examples/tutorials`` directory
[`GitHub link <https://github.com/eradiate/eradiate/tree/main/docs/examples/tutorials>`_].
