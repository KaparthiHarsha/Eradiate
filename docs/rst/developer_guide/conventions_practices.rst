Conventions and development practices
=====================================

This pages briefly explains a few conventions and practices in the Eradiate
development team.

Style
-----

The Eradiate codebase is written following Python's
`PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. Its code formatter of
choice is `Black <https://https://black.readthedocs.io/>`_ and its import formatter of
choice is `isort <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/>`_ (version 5 or later), for
which configuration files are provided at the root of the project. We also use
the PyCharm CE IDE and its built-in formatting facilities, which yield similar
but slightly different results.
