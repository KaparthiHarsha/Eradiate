What's new
==========

.. note::
   For now, Eradiate uses a
   "`Zero <https://0ver.org/>`_\ `Cal <https://calver.org/>`_\ Ver" versioning
   scheme. The ZeroVer part reflects the relative instability of our API:
   breaking changes may happen at any time. The CalVer part gives an idea of how
   fresh the version you are running is. We hope, in the future, to switch to a
   versioning scheme closer to SemVer.

   We obviously won't change things just for fun, and updates are tracked in
   this change log. Every time you decide to update to a newer version, we
   recommend that you to go through the list of changes.

v0.22.1 (unreleased)

This is the first official release of Eradiate.
