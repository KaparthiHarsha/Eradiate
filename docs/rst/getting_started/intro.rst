What is Eradiate?
-----------------

Eradiate is a new-generation radiative transfer model for Earth observation
applications. It primarily targets calibration/validation applications and
focuses on delivering highly accurate results.

Eradiate is built around a computational kernel based on the Mitsuba 2 rendering
system. It provides abstractions to conveniently build scenes, manage kernel
runs and collect results.

What can I do with Eradiate
---------------------------

Perform simulations on one-dimensional scenes.
    Currently, Eradiate supports simulations on one-dimensional scenes
    consisting of a flat surface and an atmosphere.

*More features are coming soon!*
