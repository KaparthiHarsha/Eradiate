Conventions in Eradiate
=======================

Eradiate aims at building bridges between communities. In some cases, this can
however lead to difficult situations due to identical wording or names meaning
different things. For concepts, Eradiate has a glossary; for other things
bound to a convention (*e.g.* the practical definition of angles used in
spherical coordinates), this page should settle things.

Principal plane orientation
---------------------------

Unless told otherwise, Eradiate indexes principal plane data using a signed
zenith angle in the [-90°, 90°] range, with the positive half-plane containing
the illumination direction. For this follows:

.. important::
   *On principal plane plots, the illumination is located to the right.*
