List available solar irradiance spectrum datasets
-------------------------------------------------

Find the list of available datasets in the
:mod:`solar_irradiance_spectra <eradiate.data.solar_irradiance_spectra>`
module documentation, or by running:

.. code-block:: python

    import eradiate.data as data
    display(data.registered(category="solar_irradiance_spectrum"))

Quick description of the available datasets
-------------------------------------------

Here is a quick description of each of the available solar irradiance
spectrum datasets:

- ``blackbody_sun``: theoretical irradiance spectrum, based on Planck's law
  for the blackbody spectral radiance:

  .. math::

    L_{\lambda}(T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5 (e^{hc/k\lambda T} - 1)}

  where :math:`h` and :math:`k` are the Planck and Boltzmann constants
  respectively, :math:`c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, :math:`\lambda` is
  the wavelength, with a blackbody temperature :math:`T` of 5800 K ---
  which is roughly the temperature of the Sun's photosphere. The envelope of the
  Sun's irradiance spectrum approximates that of a blackbody radiator. While
  converting from spectral radiance to spectral irradiance, using the equation:

  .. math::

    \phi_{\lambda}(T) = \frac{\pi R^2}{D^2} L_{\lambda} (T)

  the radius of the blackbody (:math:`R`) is set to the solar radius constant
  (695.7e6 km) and the distance of the blackbody to the Earth (:math:`D`) is set
  to 1 astronomical unit (149.5978707e6 km) which is the Sun-Earth average
  distance. The wavelength range extends from 280 nm to 2400 nm to cover
  Eradiate's wavelength range. Reference:
  :cite:`Liou2002IntroductionAtmosphericRadiation`.

- ``meftah_2017``: reference solar irradiance spectrum based on observations
  from the SOLSPEC instrument of the SOLAR payload onboard the internationial
  space station. The spectrum was built using observation data from 2008 for
  the [165, 656] nm wavelength range and from 2010-2016 for the [656, 3000] nm
  wavelength range. The spectrum is said to be representative of the 2008 solar
  minimum which corresponds to the end of the solar cycle 23 and the beginning
  of the solar cycle 24. Wavelength range: [165.0, 3000.1] nm. Resolution:
  better than 1 nm below 1000 nm, and 1 nm in the [1000, 3000] nm wavelength
  range. Absolute uncertainty: 1.26 % (1 standard deviation). Total solar
  irradiance: 1372.3 +/- 16.9 W/m^2 (1 standard deviation). Reference:
  :cite:`Meftah2017SOLARISSReference`.

- ``solid_2017``: observational solar irradiance spectrum composite based on
  data from 20 different instruments. The dataset provides daily solar
  irradiance spectra from 1978-11-7 to 2014-12-31. Wavelength range: [0.5,
  1991.5] nm. Resolution: variable, between 1 and 16 nm. Reference:
  :cite:`Haberreiter2017ObservationalSolarIrradiance`. See also
  `the Cal/Val Portal of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites
  <http://calvalportal.ceos.org/solar-irradiance-spectrum>`_

.. note::
    Due to its larger size, the ``solid_2017`` dataset is not shipped with the
    code base. You can download it from the eradiate FTP server
    (`download link <https://eradiate.eu/data/solid_2017.zip>`_).
    Extract the archive into a temporary location then copy-merge the folder
    in ``resources/data``.

- ``solid_2017_mean``: time-average of the ``solid_2017`` dataset over all days
  from 1978-11-7 to 2014-12-31.

- ``thuillier_2003``: reference solar irradiance spectrum based on observations
  from the SOLSPEC instrument during the ATLAS-1 mission (from 1992-03-24 to
  1992-04-02) and the SOSP instrument onboard the EURECA satellite
  (from 1992-8-7 to 1993-7-1), and on the Kurucz and Bell (1995) synthetic
  spectrum. Wavelength range: [200, 2397] nm. Resolution: 1 nm. The mean
  absolute uncertainty is of 2 to 3 %. The spectrum is representative of
  moderately high solar activity. Total solar irradiance: 1367.7 W/m^2.
  Reference: :cite:`Thuillier2003SolarSpectralIrradiance`.

- ``whi_2008_*``: combination of simultaneous satellite observations from the
  SEE and SORCE instruments (from 2008-03-25 to 2008-04-16) onboard the TIMED
  satellite and a prototype EVE instrument onboard a sounding rocket launched
  on 14 April 2008. Wavelength range: [116.5, 2399.95] nm (the wavelengthes
  [0.5, 116.5]nm was cutoff). Resolution: 0.1 nm. Representative of solar cycle
  minimum conditions. The WHI campaign produced three spectra, corresponding to
  three time periods (numbered 1, 2, 3 here):

    - ``whi_2008_1``: from 2008-03-25 to 2008-03-29, "sunspot active" spectrum.
      Total solar irradiance: 1360.70 W/m^2.

    - ``whi_2008_2``: from 2008-03-29 to 2008-04-4, "faculae active" spectrum.
      Total solar irradiance: 1360.94 W/m^2.

    - ``whi_2008_3``: from 2008-04-10 to 2008-04-16, "quiet sun" spectrum.
      Total solar irradiance: 1360.84 W/m^2.

  ``whi_2008`` is an alias to the quiet sun spectrum ``whi_2008_3``.

Visualise a solar irradiance spectrum
-------------------------------------

Let's say you chose to use the ``thuillier_2003`` dataset:

.. code-block:: python

    solar_spectrum = data.open(
        category="solar_irradiance_spectrum",
        id="thuillier_2003"
    )

You can visualise the solar irradiance spectrum corresponding to this dataset
with a simple call to the ``plot()`` method of the ``ssi`` (solar spectral
irradiance) data variable:

.. code-block:: python

    solar_spectrum.ssi.plot(linewidth=0.3)


The resulting spectrum is displayed below.

.. image:: ../../fig/thuillier_2003.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: thuillier_2003 spectrum

If the solar irradiance spectrum dataset includes a non-empty ``t`` (time)
coordinate, you must **select** the date for which you want to visualise the
spectrum:

.. code-block:: python

    solar_spectrum = data_open(
        category="solar_irradiance_spectrum",
        id="solid_2017",
    )
    solar_spectrum.ssi.sel(t="2005-03-14").plot(linewidth=0.3)

The resulting spectrum is displayed below.

.. image:: ../../fig/solid_2017.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: solid_2017 spectrum

Find out whether a solar irradiance spectrum includes a non-empty time
coordinate by printing the content of ``solar_spectrum.dims``; in the dictionary
that is printed, the value for the ``t`` key indicates the number of time
stamps. If the number is 0, the time coordinate is empty. If the number is
larger than zero, the dataset supports selection by time stamps.
