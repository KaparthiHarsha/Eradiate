    CKD correctness check
    =====================

    We check for correctness when using CKD modes with atmosphere-free scenes.
    This test is designed to check that the CKD infrastructure
    (preprocessing, spectral loop, postprocessing) works.

    Rationale
    ---------

    Create a ``OneDimExperiment`` instance with no atmosphere, a Lambertian
    surface with reflectance equal to 1 and a ``MultiDistantMeasure``:

    * Sensor: Distant measure covering a plane (25 angular points,
      10^6 sample per pixel) and targeting (0, 0, 0).
    * Illumination: Directional illumination with a zenith angle
      :math:`\theta = 0.0Â°` with black body irradiance spectrum.
    * Surface: a square surface with a Lambertian BRDF with 100 % reflectance.
    * Integrator: path tracer.

    Expected behaviour
    ------------------

    Recorded BRF must be exactly equal to one for all defined spectral bins.
