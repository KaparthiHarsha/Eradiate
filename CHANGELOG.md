# What's new

```{note}
   For now, Eradiate uses a
   "[Zero](https://0ver.org/)[Cal](https://calver.org/)Ver" versioning
   scheme. The ZeroVer part reflects the relative instability of our API:
   breaking changes may happen at any time. The CalVer part gives an idea of how
   fresh the version you are running is. We plan to switch to a versioning 
   scheme more similar to SemVer in the future.

   Updates are tracked in this change log. Every time you decide to update to a 
   newer version, we recommend that you to go through the list of changes.
